Bitcoin + Lightning Wallet is an [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability#Simplified_payment_verification) Bitcoin node with a Lightning node built on top of it, both available within the same Android app. 

It allows for both sending and receiving of regular Bitcoin transactions which are recorded on a public blockchain, take hours to days to settle, can have substantial fees and are intended for high value transfers.

In addition to that it supports [off-chain Bitcoin transactions](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Off-Chain_Transactions) also known as 'Lightning payments' which are private, instant, have low fees and still do not rely on a [trusted third party](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/) of any kind.

### [](#what-you-need-to-know)What you need to know

It is crucial to understand that Lightning Wallet is not a thin client to some centralized service but is instead a sovereign Bitcoin and Lightning node, which most importantly means that your money is stored right on your phone and nowhere else.

This gives you a ultimate censorship resistance: no one can "freeze your account" or cancel your transactions, but at the same time it makes you the one responsible for securing your funds.

Thankfully, this wallet is designed in such a way that money won't be lost no matter what if you do everything right. *Please be sure to read the [Essential App Guide](setting-up-bitcoin-wallet.html#setting-up-bitcoin-wallet) if you do want to use this app!*
